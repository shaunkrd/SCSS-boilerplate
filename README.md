# hanover digital : SCSS Boilerplate #

This repo can be used as a starting point for any Sass/SCSS Compass project.

### Installation ###

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the site project directory.

2. Paste in the following (replacing username and password with the Bitbucket connection details) and click enter:

            git clone https://username:password@bitbucket.org/hanoverdigital/hd-boilerplate-scss.git

3. This will create a directory named 'hd-boilerplate-scss' - check that it contains a 'config.rb' file and a populated 'src/scss' directory

4. Move the contents of the 'hd-boilerplate-scss' directory (there is no need to copy the '.git' directory or the 'README.md' file) into wherever the SCSS needs to be, perhaps the WordPress custom theme directory or the project's web root directory

5. Delete the now not needed 'hd-boilerplate-scss' directory

6. For the project specific SCSS and variables, create a directory inside 'src/scss' named 'project', and a directory within 'project' named 'templates' for the template specific SCSS
